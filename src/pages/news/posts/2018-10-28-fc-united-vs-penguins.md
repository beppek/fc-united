After a tough start to the season against Royals, the FC United side were eager to get the first W of the year. With an effort to play with 3 forwards pairs the United side played with 4 players on the defence and center. The team sheet looked like the following:

**Goal**
Alex

**Defence and Center**

- Will
- Looby
- Carl
- Delz

**Forwards #1**

- Beppe
- Dave

**Forwards #2**

- Ulf
- Ears

**Forwards #3**

- Cookie
- Alex

### First period

They got off to a good start when Ulf "The Wolf of Ball Street" scored the first goal of the game in his first shift as an FC United player. The first period would see 2 more goals, first the second goal of the season for Beppe and then a response late in the period for Penguins as they reduced the lead to 2-1.

### Second period

For the second period it looked as if the tactic to play with 4 players on the 2 defence and 1 center position was too much. Coach Carl made the call to move Ears to center and have Beppe, Ulf and Dave take turns to run a double with the third pair staying intact. The decision paid off over the period as the whole team could stay fresh and use the extra subs advantage they had over Penguins who came to the game with 2 subs and missing their regular keeper.

### Third period

Going into the third with a comfortable lead, the main job for United was to keep control of the game and shut the Penguins down. They pulled the team back, with less agressive stress on the oponent's third of the field. Still, it didn't end the scoring fest and the last goal saw youngster Dave become the first FC United player to score a hat-trick.

### Final
The team building is starting to shape up and there were moments when FC United really showed what they were capable of. But there are still kinks that need to be ironed out before they can confidently say they are the best team in Victoria (probably).
