Once again the United team were victorious in a tightly contested game where the opponent took advantage of the many mistakes the team made.

The game didn't start well for United who let 2 balls slip over the goal line before putting their first on the board. The Eagles looked hungry and capitalised on the far too many and simple mistakes of the United side who looked a pale shadow of the strong team that beat the Penguins 2 weeks prior.

Going into the third period the score was 7-4 to the Eagles and the road ahead looked tough for Captain Carl and his crew. But somehow the team were able to find the spark again and turn the game around, winning the final period 5-1.

With just over a minute left of the game Tom tied the scores on an assist from Beppe, who cemented the W for United about a minute later with just over 9 seconds to go in the game.

The result of the final period must have felt like an ice bucket poured over the young Eagles team, while United finally showed they are probably the best floorball team in Victoria once again.
